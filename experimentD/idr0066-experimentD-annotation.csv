ExpD_chicken_embryo,ExpD_chicken_embryo_stitched.ome.tif,Gallus gallus,NCBITaxon,NCBITaxon_9031,HH31,"A 7-day old chicken embryo was stained for neurofilament, cleared with benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate,  and imaged at zoom 4x (3.3 mm FOV, 4x6 tiles, 0.8 mm overlap). The excitation laser line was 561 nm, detection using a 561 nm longpass filter (561LP Edge Basic, AHF). The resulting data was fused in BigStitcher, downsampled 2x, and converted to the Imaris file format.",3.2 x 3.2 x 3.2 um,ExperimentD/data/,Cy3:Neurofilament
